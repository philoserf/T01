_A bias-toward-action design for rebuilding Toastmasters from first principles_

If we were to rebuild our organization without any restrictions from Toastmasters International, drawing inspiration from how Toastmasters was established in the mid-1920s, adapted for our modern era, we might:

## Meeting format

1. Introductions (themed)
2. Speeches
3. Feedback
4. Educational moment/practice

## Club structure

### Membership

- **Minimum viable club**: 8 people
- **Maximum**: 16 people (spawn new clubs beyond)
- **Commitment**: 3-month seasons with clear start/end

### Roles (rotate monthly, not weekly)

- **Host**: Runs meetings, manages time
- **Content Lead**: Coordinates speakers, themes
- **Growth Lead**: Handles recruitment, retention

### Administration

- No complex officer structure

## Meeting Locations

- Consistent venue (coffee shop, coworking space)
- Same day/time each week
- Physical space requirements: quiet, seats 20, allows 2-hour blocks

## Growth Model

- Personal invites only (no mass marketing)
- New members shadow one meeting before joining
- When club >16, senior members seed new club

## Modern Adaptations

- Topics relevant to current work (AI, remote leadership, startup pitches)
- Diverse speech formats (TED-style, product demos, investor pitches)
- Cross-pollination events with other clubs quarterly

## What We Drop

- Complex parliamentary procedure
- Formal titles ("Mr. Toastmaster")
- Rigid speech manuals
- Complicated award systems
- International hierarchy

## Success Metrics

- Member retention after 3 months
- Speech improvement (self-assessed)
- New club formation rate
- Meeting attendance consistency

_This design preserves peer learning and consistent practice while eliminating bureaucracy and adapting to modern professional needs._
