_A bias-toward-action design for rebuilding Toastmasters from first principles_

If we were to rebuild our organization without any restrictions from Toastmasters International, drawing inspiration from how Toastmasters was established in the mid-1920s, adapted for our modern era, we might:

# The Meeting Format (90 minutes max)

## 1. Lightning Round (15 min)

- Everyone gives a 30-second update
- No exceptions, no preparation
- Theme: "What's on your mind?"

## 2. Main Speeches (45 min)

- 3 speakers, 10-12 minutes each
- Modern formats: pitch, demo, story, lesson
- Speaker provides one specific feedback request

## 3. Rapid Feedback (20 min)

- 2-minute evaluations per speech
- Written feedback on cards (keep physical artifacts)
- Focus on what worked + one suggestion

## 4. Skill Sprint (10 min)

- One specific skill practice
- Examples: vocal variety, body language, storytelling
- Everyone participates in 30-second exercises

# Club Structure

## Membership

- **Minimum viable club**: 8 people
- **Maximum**: 16 people (spawn new clubs beyond)
- **Commitment**: 3-month seasons with clear start/end

## Roles (rotate monthly, not weekly)

- **Host**: Runs meetings, manages time
- **Content Lead**: Coordinates speakers, themes
- **Growth Lead**: Handles recruitment, retention

## Administration

- Single shared doc
- No complex officer structure
- No dues initially (pay for space/snacks as needed)

# Meeting Locations

- Consistent venue (coffee shop, coworking space)
- Same day/time each week
- Physical space requirements: quiet, seats 20, allows 2-hour blocks

# Growth Model

- Personal invites only (no mass marketing)
- New members shadow one meeting before joining
- When club reaches 16, senior members seed new club

# Modern Adaptations

- Topics relevant to current work (AI, remote leadership, startup pitches)
- Diverse speech formats (TED-style, product demos, investor pitches)
- Cross-pollination events with other clubs quarterly

# What We Drop

- Complex parliamentary procedure
- Formal titles ("Mr. Toastmaster")
- Rigid speech manuals
- Complicated award systems
- International hierarchy

# Success Metrics

- Member retention after 3 months
- Speech improvement (self-assessed)
- New club formation rate
- Meeting attendance consistency

_This design preserves peer learning and consistent practice while eliminating bureaucracy and adapting to modern professional needs._
